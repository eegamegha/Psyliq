Created report on pharmacy data using Power BI. 
The report explores sales insights based on country, time series, products, sales teams, and distributors. 
I used advanced visualizations like animated bar charts, word clouds, categorical and numerical slicers, multi-row cards, decomposition trees, KPIs, waterfall charts, donut charts, funnel charts, scatter plots, filled maps, drill-through, gauge charts, and ribbon charts.
I am excited to share the dynamic insights and trends that I uncovered in the world of pharmaceuticals!
